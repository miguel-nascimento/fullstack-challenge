First, clone this repository.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/miguel-nascimento/fullstack-challenge.git
```

Install dependencies with Yarn.

```console
$ cd mobile
$ yarn
```

I know, the installation of dependencies take a time, use this time to install Expo app in Playstore or App Store.

Now, use yarn start to run Expo.

```console
$ yarn start
```

Great! Now you only need to scam the QR Code. ðŸ˜‰

If the list of books doesn't load at the first time, please, exit from the app and return after ~10seg.
Heroku API takes a time to up the "dyno" of the backend, and unfortunately i didn't take it into consideration in the development.
Pardon.

**App tested only in Android**
